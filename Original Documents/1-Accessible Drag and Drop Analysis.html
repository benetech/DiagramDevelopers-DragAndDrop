            Use arrow keys to navigate to desired source.  Multi-select is achieved through holding down Ctrl & arrowkeys and use space bar to add to active set.  (Similar to File managers / Windows Explorer).  Note: Can not do Shift, so you can't do contigeous selection.  Arrow to destination, then you can do a paste or paste before.  Must pick a direction for paste.  Ctrl + Shift + V is paste before vs. standard Ctrl + V to paste after

            WASD and arrow keys move balloon in 2D plane. Hold down shift plus movement keys to  move balloon more slowly. Various hot key combinations move balloon to important locations in play area. After movement and after certain events, descriptive feedback is provided to user with aria-live attribute.

            Example: Drag an object across another object where speed of dragging impacts behavior. Example: A magnet dragging thorugh a coil of wire connected to a lightbulb. Change in drag speed will change induced current through the wire and brightness of the lightbulb.

            WASD and arrow keys move object in a 2D plane. Hold down shift to change movement speed. As object moves through critical locations, aria-live is used to announce changes in the application. For instance, if magnet moves quickly to the left and the lightbulb lights up, a summary of this is announced with aria-live.

            Example: Protons, neutrons, and electrons are available in three buckets. Particles can be dragged into an atom, where each particle type needs to go in a particular location. If drop location is accurate enough, particle ill move into correct location based on atomic model. Otherwise it will return to particle bucket.
