Simple	WeScheme	Web	Block based Programming Enviornment	Copy/Cut and Paste	Keyboard / (Voice - Still to be tested)	Use arrow keys to navigate to desired source.  Multi-select is achieved through holding down Ctrl & arrowkeys and use space bar to add to active set.  (Similar to File managers / Windows Explorer).  Note: Can not do Shift, so you can't do contigeous selection.  Arrow to destination, then you can do a paste or paste before.  Must pick a direction for paste.  Ctrl + Shift + V is paste before vs. standard Ctrl + V to paste after	wescheme.org	Tree View which is accessible of the Blocks
Simple	iOS Legacy VO Drag and Drop	iOS	OS manipulation of objects (applications, or content) 	Drag an icon (app or folder) to an empty location or ontop of another icon on the same screen	touch & Keyboard	Double tap and hold the item you are trying to move then slide you're finger to the spot you want to drop the item, then lift finger off screen.

Simple	iOS Picker	iOS	Slider	actuating a slider or picker object.	touch & Keyboard	Focus the picker control, and swipe up/down to adjust values		anything from switching screens from ios, to adjusting the date in a calendar, swiping between photos in a caracell object.
Simple	Web Slider	Web	Slider	adjust a slider	Keyboard	Arrow keys increment/decrement, home and end keys snap to beginning/end, page up/page down step a large amount than up or down arrow moves you.  Touch gestures allow for manipulation of single values only at this time.	http://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#slider	So page up/down are larger incremental values which can change depending on the situation.
Simple	Rotate an object about a point	Web	Slider?	Example: Rotate an arm and a leg attached to a body. As leg rotates, foot rubs on a carpet and charges are transfered into body. As arm rotates, it gets closer/farther from a metal  object that can discharge charges from body if they are too close.	Keyboard/Mouse/Touch	Rotating objects behave like web sliders. Arrow keys move them, and increment their position. Positionss along angles of rotation are described relative to important locations. Every movement, position of object is described by a screen reader.	Prototype Version

Intermediate 	iOS 11 Voice Over Drag and Drop	iOS	OS manipulation of objects (applications, or content) 	copy/cut/paste/drag and drop and create folders	touch & Keyboard	Must be in edit mode, use the actions rotar to select drag.  Navigate on your device to a destination, then you have some options to either add the currently focused item to your drag session, or paste everything in your drag session before or after the currently focused item or combine to create a new folder with all items in the drag session and currently focused item.		 
Intermediate 	iOS Legacy VO Drag and Drop	iOS	OS manipulation of objects (applications, or content) 	Drag an icon (app or folder) to an empty location or ontop of another icon on a different screen	touch & Keyboard	Double tap and hold the item you are trying to move then slide you're finger to the right or left edge of the screen for next/previous screen respetively.  Hold your finger there until screen change is announced, keep holding to subsequent screen or drop item to desired location.		
Intermediate 	Windows File Explorer	Windows	OS manipulation of objects (applications, or content) 	Dragging and dropping multiple items	Keyboard	Use Ctrl + arrow keys to move focus without cancelling selection, use Ctrl + space to select an item, or Ctrl + shift+ arrow keys to select a multiple items while preserving the other selected non-contigeous items.   use Ctrl+C or X to copy/cut respectively and use keyboard to navigate to destination, and use Ctrl+V to paste		
Intermediate	Dragging objects along a 1D line	Web	Slider?	Move 2 masses in a line closer and farther away from each other to observe the force they excert on each other.	Keyboard/Mouse/Touch	Masses look like web sliders. Arrow keys move them along 1D position line. Page up and  page down move them by 1/10 of their available range. Home and End move masses to beginning and end of their range, respectively.	Prototype Version	
Intermediate	Large Number of Drop Targets	Web	Application	Example: Drag squares into an nxn grid to create shapes and measure shape area and perimeter, where n is > 10	Keyboard/Mouse/Touch		Prototype Version	This example currently has no support for accessibility.
Difficult	iOS Legacy VO Drag and Drop	iOS	OS creation of folders	DoubleTap and hold to drag an icon (app or folder) on to either another app icon or a folder icon and hold it overtop of the destination until either a folder is created or the folder is opened and then release.	touch & Keyboard	Double tap and hold the item you are trying to move then slide you're finger to the spot you want to drop the item, then lift finger off screen.		
Difficult	Windows File Explorer	Windows	OS manipulation of objects (applications, or content) 	Dragging and dropping multiple non-contigeous items	Keyboard	Use the keyboard to arrow to the first or last item then Hold Down Shift plus arrow keys to select range multiple contigeous source items use Ctrl+C or X to copy/cut respectively and use keyboard to navigate to destination, and use Ctrl+V to paste		use of arrow keys without any modifiers (ie. Ctrl / Shift) will clear selection on all but the currently active item.
Difficult	Play with object in a 2D plane, while dragging object can mutate, when it is released object  position might change	Web	Application	Move in a 2D play area, transfer electrons from sweater to balloon, rub balloon on an insulator,  release balloon and observe it respond to electrostatic forces.  	Keyboard/Mouse/Touch	WASD and arrow keys move balloon in 2D plane. Hold down shift plus movement keys to  move balloon more slowly. Various hot key combinations move balloon to important locations in play area. After movement and after certain events, descriptive feedback is provided to user with aria-live attribute. 	(Prototype Version)	JAWS makes use of arrow keys imposssible, even with ARIA role=application
Difficult	Rubbing two things against each other	Web	Application	Example: Rub two things against each other, observing how friction causes a material to heat up and melt. If rubbing occcurs quickly, temperature rises and particles can be rubbed off of objects.	Keyboard/Mouse/Touch	WASD and arrow keys move objects up, down, left, and right in a 2D plane. Hold down shift  plus movement keys  to move object more slowly.	Prototype Version	JAWS makes use of arrow keys impossible, even with ARIA  role=application.
Difficult	Example of speed impacting drag interaction	Web	Application	Example: Drag an object across another object where speed of dragging impacts behavior. Example: A magnet dragging thorugh a coil of wire connected to a lightbulb. Change in drag speed will change induced current through the wire and brightness of the lightbulb.	Keyboard/Mouse/Touch	WASD and arrow keys move object in a 2D plane. Hold down shift to change movement speed. As object moves through critical locations, aria-live is used to announce changes in the application. For instance, if magnet moves quickly to the left and the lightbulb lights up, a summary of this is announced with aria-live.	https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/friction/latest/friction_en.html https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/faradays-law/latest/faradays-law_en.html	These examples currently has no support for accessibility.
Difficult	Sorting items from 3 buckets into 3 destinations:	Web	Sorting	Example: Protons, neutrons, and electrons are available in three buckets. Particles can be dragged into an atom, where each particle type needs to go in a particular location. If drop location is accurate enough, particle ill move into correct location based on atomic model. Otherwise it will return to particle bucket.
